Monte Carlo Sampling yield summary:
Number of spec values are in this yield data: 1
MC	Nominal - 
	Gain_dB:	Yield	0%
		Min 0	Max 0	Mean 0	Number of errors 0

MC
	Overall Yield	0%	Number of points passed	0	Total number of points	0

Estimated yield = 0% (0/0), 0 errors
Estimated yield (No opregions) = 0% (0/0)
