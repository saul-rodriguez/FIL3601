Monte Carlo Sampling yield summary:
Number of spec values are in this yield data: 1
MC	Nominal - 
	Gain_dB:	Yield	0%
		Min 0	Max 0	Mean 0	Number of errors 0

MC
	Overall Yield	100%	Number of points passed	300	Total number of points	300

Estimated yield = 100% (300/300), 0 errors
Estimated yield (No opregions) = 100% (300/300)
